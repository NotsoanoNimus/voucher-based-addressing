# Voucher-Based Addressing - A Sample Implementation
This project consists of a very simple, independent C application that demonstrates the driving algorithm behind my IPv6 proposal for Voucher-Based Addressing (VBA).

This is [part of a larger effort](https://github.com/NotsoanoNimus/draft-puhl-6man-ndp-vba-00) that I've been working on since around September 2023.
